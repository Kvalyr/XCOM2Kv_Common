# Kv_Common
Just some common functions to save me writing horrible UnrealScript boilerplate in my XCOM2 mods.
Files are symlinked into working directories of dependent mods for building against statically.

Not really intended for public consumption - Lots of logging junk and WIP functions in here. Only on GitHub for reference purposes.
